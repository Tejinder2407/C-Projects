Ans:-1
When not using user defined functions, for a large program the tasks of debugging, compiling etc may become difficult in general.
Thatâ€™s why user defined functions are extremely necessary for complex programs. The necessities or advantages are as follows,

1.It facilitates top-down modular programming. In this programming style, the high level logic of the overall problem is solved first while the details of each lower-level function are addressed later.
2.The length of a source program can be reduced by using functions at appropriate places.
It is easy to locate and isolate a faulty function for further investigations.
3.A function may be used by many other programs. 4.This means that a programmer can build on what others have already done,
 instead of starting all over again from scratch.
Example : Creating a user defined function addition()
#include <stdio.h>
int addition(int num1, int num2)
{
     int sum;
     /* Arguments are used here*/
     sum = num1+num2;

     /* Function return type is integer so we are returning
      * an integer value, the sum of the passed numbers.
      */
     return sum;
}

int main()
{
     int var1, var2;
     printf("Enter number 1: ");
     scanf("%d",&var1);
     printf("Enter number 2: ");
     scanf("%d",&var2);

     /* Calling the function here, the function return type
      * is integer so we need an integer variable to hold the
      * returned value of this function.
      */
     int res = addition(var1, var2);
     printf ("Output: %d", res);

     return 0;
}

 Ans:-2) If we keep a history of games played including the endgame results,
then we need to add symbol for this endgame results and also need to add output i.e. :-
printf("endgame results\n")
 Ans:-3)  In this workshop most of time I spent on learning user defined functions,which makes this  topic intresting. It makes programming language easy and time consuming.
I found difficulties mostly to run the program and some semicolon errors,which makes difficulty to display program.
